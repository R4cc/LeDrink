# LeDrink
Smart drink dispenser and mixer written in Blazor Server Side and .NET 6, integrating with a Raspberry Pi.

## Notes:
- Ignore the bad commit names :)
- This project is very unrefined since this was a school project with a 8 week timeframe.

# 1. Hardware
We had a raspberry pi connected to 4 pumps which were controlled by this software.
